# CreateWindowsUsers
Creates multiple windows local account users with the username pc(n) (n being a number) and the password of student. I used this in the creation of a small lab at a school I was doing some work for. You will need python installed for these scripts to work for you. Still very much a work in progress, plan to go back through and comments and a README later.
